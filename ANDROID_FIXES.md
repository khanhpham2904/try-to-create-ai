# 🔧 Android Folder Issues Fixed

## ✅ **Issues Found and Fixed:**

### 1. **Missing Splash Screen Logo**
- **Problem**: `splashscreen_logo` drawable was missing
- **Fix**: Created `splashscreen_logo.xml` in `android/app/src/main/res/drawable/`
- **Impact**: This was causing app crashes when loading

### 2. **Missing Night Mode Colors**
- **Problem**: `values-night/colors.xml` was empty
- **Fix**: Added proper color definitions for night mode
- **Impact**: Prevents resource errors in dark mode

### 3. **Missing URI Scheme**
- **Problem**: Android project didn't have a URI scheme configured
- **Fix**: Added `"scheme": "chatapp"` to app.json
- **Impact**: Fixes Expo CLI warnings and enables proper deep linking

### 4. **ADB Connection Issues**
- **Problem**: Android Debug Bridge (ADB) is not running
- **Solution**: This only affects emulator usage, not Expo Go
