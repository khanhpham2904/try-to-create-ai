# 🧹 Cache Clearing & Logout Testing Guide

## 🎯 **Problem Solved**
The frontend was caching user data in AsyncStorage, so even when users were deleted from the database, the app still thought they were logged in.

## 🔧 **Solutions Implemented**

### **1. Enhanced Logout Function**
- Now clears ALL AsyncStorage data with `AsyncStorage.clear()`
- Removes specific items: `user`, `auth_token`, `user_preferences`, `chat_history`, `user_settings`, `last_login`
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging

### **2. User Session Validation**
- Added `validateUserSession()` function that checks if user still exists in database
- Uses `getChatStatistics()` API call to validate user existence
- Automatically logs out if user no longer exists

### **3. Manual Cache Clearing**
- Added `clearCache()` function to manually clear all cached data
- Added "Clear Cache" button on Home screen for testing
- Can be called programmatically: `const { clearCache } = useAuth(); await clearCache();`

## 🧪 **Testing Steps**

### **Step 1: Test Manual Cache Clearing**
1. Open the app and log in with demo credentials
2. On Home screen, tap the "Clear Cache" button
3. Check console logs for: `🧹 Clear cache button pressed` and `✅ Cache cleared successfully`
4. You should be logged out and redirected to Welcome screen

### **Step 2: Test Enhanced Logout**
1. Log in again with demo credentials
2. Tap the logout button (🚪 icon) in top-right corner
3. Confirm logout in the alert dialog
4. Check console logs for comprehensive logout process
5. Verify you're redirected to Welcome screen

### **Step 3: Test User Validation**
1. Log in with demo credentials
2. Restart the app (close and reopen)
3. Check console logs for: `🔍 Validating user session...`
4. If user exists: `✅ User session is valid`
5. If user deleted: `❌ User no longer exists in database, logging out...`

## 📱 **New Features**

### **Clear Cache Button**
- Located on Home screen header
- Orange/warning color for visibility
- Clears all AsyncStorage data
- Shows confirmation alert

### **Enhanced Logging**
- `🧹` - Cache clearing operations
- `🔍` - User session validation
- `🚪` - Logout operations
- `👤` - User state changes
- `✅` - Successful operations
- `❌` - Failed operations

## 🚀 **Usage Examples**

### **Programmatic Cache Clearing**
```typescript
import { useAuth } from '../components/AuthContext';

const { clearCache } = useAuth();

// Clear all cache
await clearCache();
```

### **Force Logout with Cache Clear**
```typescript
import { useAuth } from '../components/AuthContext';

const { logout } = useAuth();

// This now clears all cache automatically
await logout();
```

## 🔍 **Debugging**

### **Check Current Cache**
```javascript
// In browser console or React Native debugger
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';

// List all stored keys
const keys = await AsyncStorage.getAllKeys();
console.log('Stored keys:', keys);

// Get specific item
const user = await AsyncStorage.getItem('user');
console.log('Stored user:', user);
```

### **Manual Cache Clearing**
```javascript
// Clear everything
await AsyncStorage.clear();

// Clear specific items
await AsyncStorage.removeItem('user');
await AsyncStorage.removeItem('auth_token');
```

## 📊 **Expected Behavior**

### **✅ Success Indicators:**
- Cache clearing button responds to touch
- Console shows cache clearing logs
- User is logged out after cache clear
- Navigation returns to Welcome screen
- No cached data persists after logout

### **❌ Failure Indicators:**
- Button doesn't respond
- No console logs appear
- User remains logged in after cache clear
- Cached data persists
- Navigation doesn't change

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### **Issue: Cache not clearing**
**Solution:** Check if AsyncStorage is properly imported and working

### **Issue: User validation failing**
**Solution:** Check API connection and `getChatStatistics` endpoint

### **Issue: Logout not working**
**Solution:** Verify AuthContext is properly set up and logout function is called

## 📝 **Notes**
- The cache clearing is now comprehensive and removes ALL stored data
- User session validation happens on app startup
- Manual cache clearing is available for testing and debugging
- All operations are logged for easy debugging
