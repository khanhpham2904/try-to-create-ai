3. Try to navigate - should stay on Welcome screen

## 🔧 **Debugging Tips**

2. Try the "Test Button" on Home screen to verify TouchableOpacity works
3. Check console for any error messages

2. Verify AsyncStorage is being cleared
3. Check if there are any errors in the logout function

### **If Navigation Doesn't Work After Logout:**

2. Verify AppNavigator is responding to user state changes
3. Check console for navigation errors
